In addition to the Java file, there is a file for plotting (plot.plt). This is a script file for gnuplot (http://gnuplot.info/). Gnuplot --
"Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986."

The Hipparchus math library jar files included here were the ones that were current when the software was developed. As of this writing (January, 2021) version 1.8 is now available. This software has not been tested with version 1.8.

The normal operation of this program, giving the closed-loop behavior, is implemented by using the Main() routine in TwoLinkRobotLaGrange.java. There is also a Main() routine in TwoLinkRobotEquations.java which can be used to get the open-loop behavior.
