This  version of the Two-Link Robot controller implements its control using a function written in C. Because OpenModelica converts its equations to C before executing them, it is very straightforward to interface user-written C functions with Modelica code. The one downside to this, at least using this version of OpenModelica, is that the path to the C function must be a fully qualified path (see line 56 of the source code). This means that Modelica codes that use C functions are not portable and the path must be updated anytime the code is moved from one environment to another.
